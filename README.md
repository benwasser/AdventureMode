AdventureMode
=============

A (somewhat) massively multiplayer persistent-world Dwarf Fortress-like game

This is currently in development and not really in a playable state. You can see where I'm up to at adventuremode.com which is pointed to my live development server, so expect frequent changes, downtime, and deleted dwarves.

The broad idea is to make something like Dwarf Fortress's single player adventure mode into a realtime multiplayer game with simplified mechanics. I've only played a little bit of DF and am unfamiliar with most of its mechanics, so it won't be too similar besides the terrible graphics. My eventual goal is to have players be able to construct buildings, farm, craft items, and wage wars between each other.
